# Goto Rails factory

The Sublime Text plugin allows to navigate to the corresponding factory girl's file.

## Installation

This is a description of the installation process using `Package Control`:

1. `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Package Control -> Add Repository`
2. Enter the following url in the prompt line: `https://github.com/ka8725/GoToRailsFactory`
3. `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Package Control -> Install Package`
4. Type `GoToRailsFactory` to find the plugin and choose it to complete the installation process

The installation currently is available only with these steps and the plugin is not indexed with `Package Control`. I'm not going to submit the request for the indexing while the plugin is not used somebody else.

## Usage

When you are in a Rails model or its Rspec test just press `ctrl+;` for Linux or `cmd+;` for OS X and the appropriate factory will be opened in the new tab.
